## Scoring Factor Sets

- [0] <strong>Operating System and Workstation Environment</strong>: This includes considerations such as diskless or remote workstations, NFS/shared data, encryption of data on devices, storage of decryption keys, and remote logging.
- [1] <strong>Administrator and Master Keys</strong>: We examine how administrator and master keys are handled, including second-level logging, tracing, access control, and key management.
- [2] <strong>Backup and Disaster Recovery Plan</strong>: This area encompasses redundancy management, backup strategies, and disaster recovery planning to ensure business continuity.
- [3] <strong>Authentication and Authorization</strong>: Our focus includes authentication services, third-party authentication, password checkers, LDAP schemes, profile management, and role-based access control.
- [4] <strong>Data Storage and Handling</strong>: We investigate data storage solutions such as cloud storage (e.g., NAS, S3), API security, policies for data handling, backup procedures, document management, and data encryption methods.
- [5] <strong>Networking and VPNs</strong>: This area covers zero-trust policies, independent review of information and network security, VPN configurations, and secure networking practices.
- [6] <strong>Logging, Monitoring, and Incident Response</strong>: Our examination includes logging mechanisms (e.g., black boxes, honeypots), monitoring tools, antivirus software, alarm compliance monitoring, event reporting, and incident response procedures.
- [7] <strong>Software Development Lifecycle</strong>: We assess the complete lifecycle of software development, from implementation to decommissioning, including design, deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and security auditing (e.g., API security).
- [8] <strong>Secure Development Lifecycle and Risk Management</strong>: This area focuses on secure coding practices, risk management strategies, and compliance with relevant standards and regulations.
- [9] <strong>Software Security Auditing</strong>: Our evaluation includes black-box testing, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and other software security auditing techniques.
- [A] <strong>Cryptographic and Blockchain Infrastructure</strong>: We investigate the use of cryptographic technologies (e.g., encryption, digital signatures) and blockchain-based systems in IT infrastructure.
- [B] <strong>Hardware-Oriented Security and IoT Auditing</strong>: This area covers hardware-specific security considerations, such as secure boot mechanisms, firmware updates, and auditing of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
- [C] <strong>Interfacing Protocols and APIs</strong>: Our examination includes the evaluation of interfacing protocols like MQTT, API-API interactions, trusted data exchange, mock APIs, and other related topics.
- [D] <strong>Roles, Responsibilities, Authorities, and Security Policy</strong>: We assess internal policies, operational procedures, incident handling guidelines, and role-based access control to ensure clarity on responsibilities and authorities within an organization.
- [E] <strong>AI-Oriented Ethics (Training and Implementation)</strong>: This area focuses on the ethical considerations surrounding AI development, including data sourcing, model training, testing, and deployment practices.
- [F] <strong>AI-Oriented Ethics (Live Systems)</strong>: Our evaluation includes the examination of ethics in live AI systems, such as fairness, transparency, accountability, and potential biases.
