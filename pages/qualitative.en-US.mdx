In binary math, you use bits — 0 or 1 — to express numbers.

You do this by flipping bits from 0 → 1 in a certain order.

For example, here’s how 8 is expressed:

1-0-0-0 = 8

And here’s what 7 looks like:

0-1-1-1 = 7

Notice that 7 has three bits flipped.
While 8 — the larger number — has only one!


“When you pick the right priority, it doesn’t matter if you do it well or not.”

"Doing the correct thing poorly is worth more than executing the wrong things perfectly.”


Let's end with a few examples.

Low-order bits that we see people commonly get stuck on:

- Arguing for password complexity
- arguing for various network details assuming our network provider is bulletproof.
- Constantly watching your details and ignoring main goals

Examples of high-order bits:

- Picking the right network policy
- we never look out of the box
- second level of great people for leadership


Do the right things wrong > Do the wrong things right


so If we order the questions properly the score at the end is also a scoring mark.


in the future we might see that based on the high order bits we can alter the next questions.
This is a scenario that the questions should be nodes in a 15 height binary tree and the path from the root to the leave will be the qualitative scoring of an SFS.

we see a very interesting scoring evaluation here but on the other hand is a very complicated and unfriendly way of following the changes of the evaluation of an infrastructure.



# notes
also if we care to see the progress and changes between 2 scores we cant use binary tree questions.
